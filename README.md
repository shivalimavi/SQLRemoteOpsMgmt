## Introduction
The advent of remote working, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, has reshaped traditional office dynamics and necessitated the adoption of remote work environments. This shift has been fueled by increased connectivity and a perception of enhanced productivity among employees working from home, as evidenced by a study from the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute for Economics. The study found that 30% of respondents reported increased engagement and productivity while working remotely, leading to significant time savings in commute hours. As remote work becomes increasingly prevalent globally, there arises a need for a robust system to manage, track, and analyze day-to-day operations in remote settings, alongside traditional office environments, to ensure seamless business conduct. The objective is to develop a flexible operational system that streamlines workflows, optimizes resource utilization, fosters coordination among resources, and ensures timely deliverables, thereby enhancing overall organizational efficiency and productivity.
